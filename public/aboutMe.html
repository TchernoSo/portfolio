                    <h2>96's</h2>
                    <p>
                        At the age of two, I moved from the Netherlands to Portugal, with a deep passion for football.<br>

I never left home without a ball, as it was the only thing I brought from home.<br>

Growing up in Portugal was a challenge, I would spend hours in the streets kicking the ball against the wall on my own, until I started making friends and later joined my first amateur football club.<br>

 <br>Unfortunately 4 years later, I experienced an ACL injury, which required surgery and six to eight months of recovery. By the time my circumstances changed, I had to help my parents financially, prompting me to take a break and finding a job. (I never imagined I would come back!)<br>

                        Imagine if “Jobs” didnt exist? I believe we would all end up becoming artists. <br>  

                        I truly believe we all have an artistic side, but not all of us have the courage to express it and follow it. I believe, the purpose of a human being, is to positively impact the world every single day, and Art is one of our abilities.<br> <br>  
                        
                        Growing up in an environment of music and dance, later on I decided to pursue the art of dancing. <br> <br>  
                        
                        My life once again changed after leaving another home, quitting my job, selling all my belongings, and relocating to London, a city known for its vibrant art scene, creativity, and diversity, and the rest... is History!

                    <p>
                        The pandemic!<br>The most isolated phase of my life, which gave me another level of self-awareness and a better understanding of my abilities.<br>
                        Difficult times can lead us to a deeper understanding of who we are and what we are capable of.
                        So was in the middle of chaos, I began writing down my thoughts and ideas in order to create some peace in my mind, and by the end of the pandemic, I had turned those pieces of paper into my book (TheSoul).<br>
                        Since then, I have been dedicated to writing another set of peace of papers, creating a book/roadmap where no one has to face challenges on their own"TS365".

                    <p>
                        I was encouraged to learn a new skill.<br>
                        I decided to start learning computer science and programming, something I had zero clue about, but have always been interested in understanding how technology, websites, and apps are made!<br> 
                        As far as I can tell, this journey is endless. <br>From discovering the history of human innovation and the first machines to the languages that bridge humans and technology, understanding the binary language that allows technology to comprehend our commands, to the very first line of code and building this website from scratch ufff... <br>Humans' brains are insane.
